# Memory Game
This is a classic memory game.


## Rules

* flip one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.

* turn over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.

* if the cards match, both cards stay flipped over; if the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.

* the game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
